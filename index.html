<h1>Best Movies According to Del</h1>
<h2>My top 3 of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Spy x Family</h3>
<p>
It's not really a movie but I haven't watched many so here's a good show instead.
</p>
<h3>Ready player One</h3>
<p>
It's not as good as the book.  It is a decent movie about technology and virtual worlds.
</p>
<h3>Avengers End Game</h3>
<p>
I don't remember much about it now.  I think I liked it when I watched it though.  Strangely, I watched it before Infinity War.  Both were good movies still.
